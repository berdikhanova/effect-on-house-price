##The Effect of the Year the House Was Built on the Price

The purpose of this statistics report is to determine the relationship between the year in which a house was built with the price of the house and build a regression model to make predictions for the future. Published in the public domain, this dataset contains house sale prices for King County, including Seattle. The information is based on the reports from the homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. Firstly, I state the research questions by clearly defining the null and alternative hypotheses. Secondly, I examine the data in order to evaluate all the assumptions needed to build a regression model and calculate the relevant parameters such as correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination. Thirdly, I build a single regression plot and interpret the results. The results show there is a positive relationship between the year the house was built and the price, but the relationship is rather weak. â€‹However, the results may not be accurate as there are other confounding and extraneous variables that may have influenced our study, which is why it would be useful to conduct multiple regressions and test different models.
